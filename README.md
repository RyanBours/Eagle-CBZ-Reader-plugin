A cbz file is a comic book archive file that contains images inside it. The files are compressed and stored in a .zip format and named **.cbz**.
Each image in the archive is named with a number e.g.: 01.png, 02.png, 03.png, etc. It Does not matter what the are called as long as the name is used to sort the images in the correct order.

This version works only with .png, .jpg and .jpeg files. It will not work with others.

A Test file is included > [Elf Receiver Radio-Craft August 1936.cbz](<Elf Receiver Radio-Craft August 1936.cbz>)

It only supports .cbz files.
